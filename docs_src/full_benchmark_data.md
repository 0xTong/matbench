## Coming soon!

The full data for every benchmark submitted to Matbench will be available on this page. This includes:

- an ever-growing database of every algorithm's predictions on all problems
- each algorithm's hyperparameters determined for each train/val/test fold, if reported
- statistics on the scores between folds, for various metrics (MAE, F1, ROC, RMSE, etc.)
