    "algorithm_long": "eXtreme Gradient Boosting trees (XGBoost) is applied on basic tabular data that describes the crystal lattice of each compound: lattice parameter lengths and angles, space group number, and unit cell volume. Fixed XGBoost hyperparameters were used. This serves as part of a baseline to answer the question: how much predictive performance is present in the basic details of a crystal lattice (i.e. no composition, no site information)?",
