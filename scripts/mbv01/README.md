# Attention!

All files in this directory are quite dated and were originally used to create the matbench v0.1 benchmark. Multiple amendments have been made to the datasets since then. However, these files may be used to help source the original
data and understand some of the data cleaning procedures. This code is not maintained or tested and should be treated as such.
